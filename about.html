				<div class="g-demo-list">
					<div class="g-text">iSWIM is a subsidiary of TRM (HK) Limited. We have more than 20 years of experience in handling employees’ compensation claims in Hong Kong and understand the difficulties and headache in handling such claims. Therefore, we developed a smart work injury management system (SWIM), a platform to monitor sick leave and predict the percentage of permanent disability. This project was done in collaboration with Hong Kong Polytechnic University and has also received an Innovative Technology grant. In the future, we will also use artificial intelligence to develop strategies to handle the claims.</div>
					<div class="g-text">On top of SWIM, we are also developing a solution to handle original documents of claims. We hope to provide an efficient method to handle original documents and help insurers save storage space. This also aims to reduce the manpower need to extract data from documents.</div>
					<div class="g-text">In addition to original documents handling, we also are developing APIs to integrate with insurer’s systems so as to avoid repeated data entries. The data we obtain can make the claims handling more efficient and help identify fraudulent claims.</div>
					<div class="g-text">We are happy to discuss with insurers about any solutions that will help them make claims handling more efficient and to improve their client’s experience. </div>

				<div class="g-text">Handling and storage of original documents have always been a headache for insurers. We provide a solution to handle original documents using state-of-the-art technology – “Block Chain”.</div>

				<div class="g-text">The original documents will be scanned and kept at a safe place. An QR code will be stamped on the “true copy” and passed to the related parties.</div>

				<div class="g-text">Insurers can extract data from the documents, retrieve copies of the originals, or retrieve the original documents. All handling of documents will be logged and cannot be amended. </div>

				<div class="g-text">Workflow can be kickstarted to ensure proper handling based on the document type. The documents as well as the data can be embedded with the workflow for reference. </div>

				<div class="g-demo-list">
					<div class="g-text">Insurers need to extract data from paper documents to process claims. This process involves a lot of manpower and also could result in human errors. iSWIM provides a solution to extract data from documents and store it in a blockchain database.</div>
					<div class="g-text">The data can be passed to insurers through data files or an API. This will reduce human errors during repeated data entries.</div>
					<div class="g-text">We can also check data from various sources such as the Labour Department, Hospital Authority etc. to ensure data integrity. This helps to identify fraudulent claims.  </div>

					<div class="g-text">Data is important in claims handling. However, it is hard to visualize the pattern when there is too much data. iSWIM uses various data visualization techniques to present data in easily understandable formats.</div>
					<div class="g-text">Insurers can identify different patterns, especially for exceptional claims patterns. It helps to identify doctor shoppers, unattended cases or fraudulent claims.</div>

				<div class="g-demo-list">
					<div class="g-text">In 2018, TRM collaborated with PolyU to apply for an innovative grant to develop a Smart Work Injury Management platform (“SWIM”). Based on more than 100,000 cases from various industries, the platform utilized artificial intelligence technology (“AI”) to predict sick leave duration and percentage of permanent disability. </div>
					<div class="g-text">At the end, we developed a model for managing work injury claims from the first day of the injury until the case closed. Most importantly, it facilitates proactive rehabilitation and the early return to work. At the end, insurers can save cost in employees’ compensation claim.</div>
